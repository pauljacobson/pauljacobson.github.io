## Love

From Khalil Gibran's "Love":

> Love gives naught but itself and takes
> naught but from itself.
>      Love possesses not nor would it be
> possessed;
>      **For love is sufficient unto love**.

and 

> Love has no other desire but to fulfil
> itself.
>      But if you love and must needs have
> desires, let these be your desires:
>      To melt and be like a running brook
> that sings its melody to the night.
>      **To know the pain of too much tenderness**.
>      To be wounded by your own under-
> standing of love;
>      **And to bleed willingly and joyfully**.
>      To wake at dawn with a winged heart
> and give thanks for another day of loving;
>      To rest at the noon hour and meditate
> loveâ€™s ecstasy;
>      To return home at eventide with grati-
> tude;
>      And then to sleep with a prayer for the
> beloved in your heart and a song of praise
> upon your lips.
