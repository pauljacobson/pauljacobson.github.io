  <h2>My Journey To Code</h2>

  <p>This isn't my first career by any means. It isn't even <a href="https://pauljacobson.me/2015/02/15/returning-14-year-old-career/" target="_blank">my first passion</a>  but I've wanted to become a developer for decades.</p>
  
  <p>When I became unemployed in April 2017, I decided to make good use of my time at home, in between applying for content marketing positions and taking on freelance writing work. I decided to go back to the beginning and learn front-end/web development.</p>
  
  <p>I started with HTML, which I was already fairly familiar with, and moved on to CSS, which I really enjoyed. There is something about HTML and CSS that really appeals to me. I think this is because with HTML and CSS, you can *see* the changes happening just by refreshing your browser window.</p>

    <h3>It started with a birthday</h3>

      <p class="birthday_site--text">Of course, as I learned, I had to put my new knowledge to use. I started with a little site for my wife to wish her a happy birthday.</p>
